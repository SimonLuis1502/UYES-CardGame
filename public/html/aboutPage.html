        <p>
            UYES! is a turn-based, web-based card game that we developed as part of our university coursework. Inspired by the classic UNO, players compete to tactically play cards and win the round – all directly in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game supports real-time multiplayer, features a clean interface, and runs smoothly across devices. It’s designed to be quick, colorful, and fun – whether you’re playing on your own or with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal: combine simple rules with technical depth and create something that’s both enjoyable and technically solid.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are five students from the <strong>DHBW Mannheim</strong>, currently studying Business Informatics (Wirtschaftsinformatik). As part of our studies, we were given the challenge to build an interactive browser game from scratch – both frontend and backend included.
        </p>
        <p>
            We – <strong>Andrii</strong>, <strong>Bilal</strong>, <strong>Daria</strong>, <strong>Simon</strong>, and <strong>Srisharanya</strong> – decided on a UNO-inspired concept that combines rounds, multiplayer, and web technologies in a fun way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this project, we deepened our knowledge in full-stack development, real-time communication (WebSockets), responsive design, and agile collaboration.
