    <h2>UYES! Rulebook</h2>
    <p>
        UYES! is an UNO inspired card game. When creating a lobby the host can
        choose the number of players, how many cards everyone starts with and
        which special cards are included.
    </p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player receives the selected amount of starting cards (7 by default).</li>
        <li>The remaining cards become the draw pile. Reveal the top card to start the discard pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Taking a Turn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Play a card that matches the color or number of the top discard.</li>
        <li>If you have no playable card, draw one. You may play it immediately if it fits; otherwise your turn ends.</li>
        <li>Whenever you have exactly one card left you must press the “UYES!” button before the turn ends. Forgetting or pressing it too early makes you draw a penalty card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Card Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number cards</strong>: 1–9 in red, yellow, green and blue.
            <span class="card small blue"><span><span>5</span></span></span>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Draw Two</strong> (+2):
            <span class="card small red"><span><span>2+</span></span></span>
            the next player draws two cards and is skipped. Stacking draw cards is allowed.
            So stacked cards add their draw value and the last player who doesn't stack has
            to draw the cumulated amount of cards and is skipped.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Skip</strong>:
            <span class="card small yellow"><span><span><i class="fas fa-ban specialCard"></i></span></span></span>
            the next player loses their turn.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reverse</strong>:
            <span class="card small green"><span><span><i class="fas fa-retweet specialCard"></i></span></span></span>
            changes the playing direction. With two players it works like Skip.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wild</strong>:
            <span class="card small wild"><span><span>W</span></span></span>
            choose the color that continues play.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wild Draw Four</strong> (+4):
            <span class="card small wild"><span><span>4+</span></span></span>
            choose a color, the next player draws four cards and is skipped.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Running out of Cards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new one.</li>
        <li>The first player who discards all their cards wins the round.</li>
    </ul>
